SURF for IPOL - 2015

This software is divided into 3 bins that can compute SURF descriptors, SURF matches and display them on images.

The article reference can be found on IPOL.

Last update: —— (4th release)
Main changes:
* cleaner code
* bin file is separated into 3 files

1) Compilation
Do "make" in command line. "make clean" to clean the .o files.

2) Usage
Cd in /bin folder. To detect keypoints:

./extract_surf ../examples/gobelet.png k1.txt
./extract_surf ../examples/gobelet2.png k2.txt

To match keypoints:

./match_surf k1.txt k2.txt matches.txt

And to display:

./display_surf k1.txt k2.txt matches.txt ../examples/gobelet.png ../examples/gobelet2.png descriptor.png matches.png
