Before running test cases, the fast_imas_IPOL executable must be compiled and linked, including the OpenCV library.
To use GeoTIFF images with the ASIFT executable, the GDAL executables and Python libraries must be installed as well.
Instructions to do both these requirements are in the ./fast_imas_IPOL/README.md file, as well as instructions for the executable.
