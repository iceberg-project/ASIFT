title: "4D Use Case: ASIFT Scratch Directory"
---

Overview
--------

There is no code in this directory. Simply a “Scratch_Directory_Log.csv” file,
and working directory subfolders containing the intermediate results (tiles,
individual ASIFT results) for input files. The logfile and the contents of this
folder are maintained completely by the
“../PHASE_1_IMAGE_PREPROCESSING/Scratch_Directory_Manager.py” script. See the
README.md in the “PHASE_1_IMAGE_PREPROCESSING” directory for usage.
